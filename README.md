# cars-analyzer

## Description

The idea of this project is to analyze the data of cars and their prices in the market. 

I will grab the data from https://www.autoscout24.com/, which a website for buying and selling cars in Europe.

The data will be exposed for prometheus to scrape it and then I will use Grafana to visualize the data.

Also, will create a ML model to predict the price of the cars, based on:
* Make and model
* Year
* Mileage
* Fuel type
* Transmission

## Features
* Keep track of the cars that are being sold in the market
* Keep track of the prices of the cars
* Keep track of the features of the cars
* Keep track of the location of the cars
* Keep track of the time of the cars being sold
